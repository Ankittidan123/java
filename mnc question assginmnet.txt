XYZ Technologies is in the process of increment the salary of the employees. This
increment is done based on their salary and their performance appraisal rating.
If the appraisal rating is between 1 and 3, the increment is 10% of the salary.
If the appraisal rating is between 3.1 and 4, the increment is 25% of the salary.
If the appraisal rating is between 4.1 and 5, the increment is 30% of the salary.
Help them to do this, by writing a program that displays the incremented salary. Write a
class “IncrementCalculation.java” and write the main method in it.
Note : If either the salary is 0 or negative (or) if the appraisal rating is not in the range 1 to
5 (inclusive), then the output should be “Invalid Input”.
Sample Input 1 :
Enter the salary
8000

Enter the Performance appraisal rating

Sample Output 1 :
8800
Sample Input 2 :
Enter the salary
7500
Enter the Performance appraisal rating

Sample Output 2 :

Sample Input 3 :
Enter the salary
-5000
Enter the Performance appraisal rating

Problem Statement – Goutam and Tanul plays by telling numbers. Goutam says a number
to Tanul. Tanul should first reverse the number and check if it is same as the original. If yes,
Tanul should say “Palindrome”. If not, he should say “Not a Palindrome”. If the number is
negative, print “Invalid Input”. Help Tanul by writing a program.

Blue Bandit wants the list of prime numbers available in a range of numbers.Can you help
him out?
Write a java program to print all prime numbers in the interval [a,b] (a and b, both inclusive).
Note
Input 1 should be lesser than Input 2. Both the inputs should be positive.
Range must always be greater than zero.
If any of the condition mentioned above fails, then display “Provide valid input”
Use a minimum of one for loop and one while loop
Sample Input 1:
